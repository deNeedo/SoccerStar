Marking Training (The Shadow You Can't Escape)
Your new job is simple: be the annoying shadow that defenders can't shake off. Today, you’ll be tailing players so closely they’ll start calling you their twin.. conjoined twin. If you’re not stepping on their heels or breathing down their necks, you’re doing it wrong. Every insult thrown at you, every swear said under their breath is your motivation. By the end of this session, you must be as good at marking, players will ask for restraining orders.
