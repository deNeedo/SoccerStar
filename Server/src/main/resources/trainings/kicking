Kicking Training (The Boot of Doom)
Your feet are your new weapons, and today we’ll turn them into missiles of destruction! You’ll be kicking balls at targets, walls, and probably some unlucky bystanders. There’s a rumor one guy kicked a ball so hard, it left orbit. Can you top that? Warning: aim poorly and the ball might come back for revenge.
