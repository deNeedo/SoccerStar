Shooting Training (The Sniper's Gamble)
Did you ever see the fired bullet? Yes? American? Doesn't matter, Today you are the gun and your bullet is a ball. Fire it right into the window, yes in that old building, I think no one is living there. Your goal is to break through this boarded-up window aaand don't get arrested. Good luck.
