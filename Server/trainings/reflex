Reflex Training (The Lightning Reflex Gauntlet)
Do you flinch at the sight of a fast-moving ball? Well, too bad! In this training, youâ€™ll dodge an army of flying bal.. balls like objects. You know cones, rocks, bricks and anything cheap enough. When you finally start earning money like an footballer, maybe it will be just balls.
