Passing Training (The Laser Pass of Destiny)
Passing is a complicated ability, not bacause its so hard to learn, just you need other people. And we know you don't have friends and we don't have that budget to rent some. So your friend is Derek, Derek the dummy, pass him the ball as powerfull to make it bounce exactly where you want, and don't miss. To simulate that Derek is runing, you gonna run. Don't damage him, he has got strong friends, unlike you.
